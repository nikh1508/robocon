>The project folder contains code for NodeMCU and Arduino.

>The mobile app used is **"Blynk"**.

>The bot is T-shaped with two traction at the back and a dummu omni-wheel at the front.

>The NodeMCU receives data from the blynk server and transmits all the required data through Serial communication.

>The Arduino further manipulates the received x, y , trim and max_speed_slider data for driving a differential drive.
